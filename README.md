# Translate It!

This is a website designed to teach children from the age of 6 years and over how to build their vocabulary and conversation skills in Lithuanian through the creation of a library of English words that are then translated into Lithuanian. 

The site features an individual word search, categories of words, the meaning of a word, helpful information related to a word, as well as how to use them in a sentence, to support their use in conversation. 


The website is deployed live at [https://my-translate-it.herokuapp.com/](https://my-translate-it.herokuapp.com/)

# UX

The site is for children (and their parents) who would like to start building their vocabulary of useful words in Lithuanian through the creation of a word library to enhance their conversational skills. The easy to use interface features word search, words arranged by category, definitions and helpful information, as well as the ability to add a user’s own words. There is an Administrator’s Portal where additional categories can be added.

This was my inital design for the website. During development the flow of data and website design changed for the better. 
The biggest change was the information on the translation, materilize had a great card feture that helpped with selecting data.

### Design
The strategy for the design was to create an easy using website that naturally took the user on a seamless journey to first find a word, via word search or category search. If a word was not found they are then asked to log in and add it themself. If the user adds a word their profile page will host only their words and the word is also added to the library for other users.

Colour and font
Colour and font were taken into account in order to make the interface simple to navigate and use, but also incorporated best practices in terms of accessibility, in order to cater for users of all learning abilities.
